# Movie-Trailer-Website
Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree - Project #1

### by Matt DuWaldt

## What it is and does

A Python program that produces the HTML for a movie trailer website that displays
a number of movies. Users can click on a movie poster to play its trailer.

## Required libraries and dependencies

Python 2.x is required to run this project. The Python executable should be in
your default path, which the Python installer should have set automatically. 

## Project contents

This project is comprised of the following files:

* entertainment_center.py - the main Python script to run
* media.py - contains the class Movie that stores movie details (title, storyline, poster image URL, 
  and Youtube trailer URL)
* fresh_tomatoes.py - creates the HTML file for the website (Udacity supplied; slightly edited HTML for appearance)

## How to run this project

Download the project zip file to your computer and unzip the file. Alternatively, clone this
repository to your desktop.

Open the file entertainment_center.py and run. A file index.html will be generated and loaded in a new tab on your browser.
